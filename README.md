# recycle_mapping
The goal of this project is create a database for locations of recycling in each county found in Michigan.
  I followed these Steps to Create the Project/Code:
  1. Web-scraped a website containing locations of all recycling centers in Michigan 
  2. Cleaned the data scrapped and inported it into a CSV file
  3. Cleaned the data and used Dash by Plotly and Mapbox to visualize the locations on a map
